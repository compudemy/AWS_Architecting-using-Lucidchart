Architecture on Building &amp; Distributing new AMIs in the AWS Cloud

<P> In thw AWS cloud, finely tuned, well-architected infrastructure plans helps the cloud to scale to their full potential.</p>

Architectures helps your team to monitor, secure, automate, and optimize resources.
For AWS cloud servers, a great way to avoid these kinds of technical constraints on your team is by building a “Golden AMI pipeline”, that establishes a baseline configuration for acceptable EC2 instances by each of your organization’s business units. This can prove to be especially useful when your organization has several development teams that don’t communicate, but need to comply by the same security and compliance standards. With this pipeline in place, individual teams can move more quickly and autonomously.
